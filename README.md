# Predicting Customer Booking Intent for British Airways Using Machine Learning

# Project Description:

This project aimed to develop a predictive model that can accurately identify whether a customer is likely to complete a booking with British Airways. Using real-world booking data, I carried out essential data preprocessing, which included minor data cleaning to address inconsistencies and missing values.

One of the major challenges in the dataset was class imbalance. To address this, I applied random oversampling (upsampling) exclusively on the training set, ensuring the model was not biased towards the majority class.

I implemented a Random Forest Classifier, coupled with hyperparameter tuning using RandomizedSearchCV and cross-validation, to optimize the modelâ€™s performance and ensure robust generalization. Through this process, I achieved the following:

âœ… 95% test set score

âœ… 82% average cross-validation accuracy

âœ… 76% precision

âœ… 99% recall

âœ… 86% F1 score

âœ… 96% ROC AUC score during cross-validation

Furthermore, I identified and showcased the top 5 most important features contributing to the prediction, offering insights into customer behavior and booking patterns.

This project strengthened my understanding of classification modeling, cross-validation techniques, evaluation metrics, and how to handle imbalanced data effectively. It was a valuable hands-on experience in real-world predictive modeling, and I am grateful to British Airways for the opportunity and access to the dataset.
